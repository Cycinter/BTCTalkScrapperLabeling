The computing credits can then be used to secure the right to define the data and algorithm of each computational chunk.  The CPUs of the BC users solve these chunks and send the results back to the drug company. As before, the BC user gets newly generated Bitcoins in return for computing each chunk. In addition, the user receives the Bitcoins paid by the drug company.\n",

By this I mean simply that BC is a medium of exchange by design and by declaration, not through natural market selection.  Taking gold as an example, the market had already chosen and accepted gold as a medium of exchange long before governments got involved and \"endorsed\" it.\n",

In my opinion, what I2P is missing is an underlying agreeable cryptocurrency which it's nodes can earn by keeping the network online, and it's members can use as a form of payment.  If this were the case, BC would probably start having some intrinsic value within the I2P community which creates a positive feedback loop for I2P: more nodes pop up, stronger network, etc.  And next thing you know, a completely encrypted and anonymous internet can emerge in parallel to the existing one.  I think this would be incredible, especially being able to jump between the two.\n",
